1. Start at a random position on the chess board.
2. Move a Knight's Distance away from the current piece
3. 
    a. If all the positions on the chess board have been touched, you can stop, because you've found a solution.
    b. If all pieces that your Knight can go to from its current solution have already been visited, then that mean your Knight is "trapped"
4. If a piece is trapped go back one instance to when that piece was not on the
chess board and place the piece on a different position (one that hasn't been
tried yet). If all possible positions have been tried, than back track once
more.
5. Otherwise place a new piece if you find a valid unused position for it.
